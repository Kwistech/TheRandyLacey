				The inspiration for my writing came as a result from a poetry assignment by my grade 9 English teacher. I reluctantly set to task on the assignment. After grading the assignments, he took me aside and suggested I consider continuing writing and seek to publish my work. <br><br>
				<strong>At that encouragement the dream was born </strong><br><br>
				In 2010, I was hospitalized for 5 months. It was during that time that the ambition to publish my work was reborn. Four months after my release from the hospital, I had the first of 13 eye surgeries, which left me mostly blind. I was now blind in one eye and not able to see out of the other.<br><br>
				In 2013, I realized the dream of publishing my first book, Blind Ambitions. It took me going blind for me to become ambitious about carrying on with my writing. That ambition carried over to other things like spice blending, creating and hot sauces. After the publication of Blind Ambitions, I started writing my memoir with the intent to publish it so that my story might help prevent somebody from trekking down the same path I did.
				In 2015 like most people I made a New Yearâ€™s resolution. Again, like most people who make resolutions I failed after only thirteen days. Unfazed by this I re-evaluated the end goal and then redefined it. Before the year ended, I had attained my goal. After four years of editing and formatting, my second book of poetry, Resolutions Book 1 was published. Book 2 & 3 will be released later in 2019.
